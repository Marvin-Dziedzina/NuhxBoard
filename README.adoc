== Goals

https://github.com/ThoNohT/NohBoard[Nohboard] is great! But it's only for Windows. The only alternative is https://github.com/Tiyenti/kbdisplay[Tiyenti's KBDisplay], which is quite nice, but limited in functionality. My primary goal with this project is to replicate the functionality of NohBoard in a cross-compatible manner. More specifically, I want to be able to feed in any NohBoard config file and have near-identical output to NohBoard.

I may add functionality where I think it would fit, but I want to prioritize interoperability with NohBoard. Call it just another incentive for gamers to switch to Linux.

== Usage

NuhxBoard is made with customizability in mind. Every part of its appearance and behavior is configurable. At its core, NuhxBoard is an app that loads keyboard layouts and styles. A keyboard layout defines the positions, shapes, and behaviors of keys. It also defines the dimensions of the window. A style defines colors, fonts, and (in a future release) images for keys.

Keyboard layouts are grouped into categories, and styles (aside from global ones) correspond to specific keyboard layouts.

Keyboards are located in `~/.local/share/NuhxBoard/keyboards`. Here's the general structure of that directory:

* keyboards/
** [CATEGORY NAME]/
*** [KEYBOARD NAME]/
**** keyboard.json
**** [STYLE NAME].style
*** global/
**** [STYLE NAME].style

This folder will be populated on first run with some example keyboards and categories. You can inspect it yourself to get a good idea of how this looks in practice.

To load a keyboard and style, right-click anywhere in NuhxBoard to open the global context menu and click on "Load Keyboard". This will open a new window. The drop-down list labeled "Categories" allows you to select a category. When a category has been selected, the keyboards available in that category will appear in a list on the left side of the vertical line. When you click on one of these options, your selection of keyboard layout will be loaded, and that keyboard layout's available styles will appear in a list on the right side of the vertical line. When you click on one of these options, your selection of style will be loaded. You can change you selection of keyboard layout and style at any time through this interface.

=== Keyboard Layouts

As previously stated, keyboard layouts define key positions, shapes, and behaviors, as well as window dimensions. Keyboard layouts are defined by a JSON file, `keyboard.json`, in their corresponding named directory. Here's what the type definition for a keyboard layout looks like in rust:

[source, rust]
----
include::./src/types/config.rs[lines=4..23]
