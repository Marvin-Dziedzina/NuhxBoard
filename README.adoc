== Goals

https://github.com/ThoNohT/NohBoard[Nohboard] is great! But it's only for Windows. The only alternative is https://github.com/Tiyenti/kbdisplay[Tiyenti's KBDisplay], which is quite nice, but limited in functionality. My primary goal with this project is to replicate the functionality of NohBoard in a cross-compatible manner. More specifically, I want to be able to feed in any NohBoard config file and have near-identical output to NohBoard.

I may add functionality where I think it would fit, but I want to prioritize interoperability with NohBoard. Call it just another incentive for gamers to switch to Linux.

== Usage

NuhxBoard is made with customizability in mind. Every part of its appearance and behavior is configurable. At its core, NuhxBoard is an app that loads keyboard layouts and styles. A keyboard layout defines the positions, shapes, and behaviors of keys. It also defines the dimensions of the window. A style defines colors, fonts, and (in a future release) images for keys.

Keyboard layouts are grouped into categories, and styles (aside from global ones) correspond to specific keyboard layouts.
